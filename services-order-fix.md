# Services Order Fix Documentation

## Overview
Fixed the order of services in the "What We Do" section on the homepage by swapping "Additional Services" and "Project Management" positions as requested.

## Issue Addressed
**Problem**: The services in the "What We Do" section were in the wrong order:
- ❌ Commercial Construction (1st) ✓
- ❌ Residential Services & Renovations (2nd) ✓  
- ❌ Additional Services (3rd) - should be 4th
- ❌ Project Management (4th) - should be 3rd

**Solution**: Reordered the `servicesData` array in `Services.js` to place Project Management before Additional Services.

## New Correct Order
1. **Commercial Construction** (unchanged)
2. **Residential Services & Renovations** (unchanged)
3. **Project Management** (moved from 4th to 3rd position)
4. **Additional Services** (moved from 3rd to 4th position)

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified: `src/components/Services.js`

#### Before (Lines 8-81):
```javascript
const servicesData = [
  {
    id: 'commercial',
    title: 'Commercial Construction',
    // ... commercial data
  },
  {
    id: 'residential', 
    title: 'Residential Services & Renovations',
    // ... residential data
  },
  {
    id: 'additional',           // ❌ Was 3rd
    title: 'Additional Services',
    // ... additional services data
  },
  {
    id: 'project',              // ❌ Was 4th
    title: 'Project Management',
    // ... project management data
  }
];
```

#### After (Lines 8-81):
```javascript
const servicesData = [
  {
    id: 'commercial',
    title: 'Commercial Construction',
    // ... commercial data
  },
  {
    id: 'residential',
    title: 'Residential Services & Renovations', 
    // ... residential data
  },
  {
    id: 'project',              // ✅ Now 3rd
    title: 'Project Management',
    // ... project management data
  },
  {
    id: 'additional',           // ✅ Now 4th (last)
    title: 'Additional Services',
    // ... additional services data
  }
];
```

## Visual Impact

### Service Tabs Order:
Now displays in the correct order:
1. **COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION** - Core business service
2. **RESIDENTIAL SERVICES & RENOVATIONS** - Home services
3. **PROJECT MANAGEMENT** - Engineering expertise highlighting
4. **ADDITIONAL SERVICES** - Supplementary outdoor services

### Business Logic:
- **Strategic Positioning**: Project Management (core expertise) before Additional Services
- **Flow**: Main construction services → Management expertise → Additional offerings
- **Emphasis**: Highlights engineering background earlier in sequence

## Files Changed
- ✅ `src/components/Services.js` (Lines 8-81) - Reordered servicesData array

## Result
The "What We Do" section now displays services in the requested order, with Project Management appearing as the third tab and Additional Services as the fourth (final) tab.

## Testing
- ✅ Service tabs display in correct order
- ✅ All service content remains intact
- ✅ Navigation between tabs works properly
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ No broken functionality
